# Data literacy

Data literacy means that, wherever possible, decisions should be based on data not hunches or guesses. Data isn’t just for ‘geeks’, non-specialists must understand its importance

Let's **join the open ecosystem** and learn how to engage with data leveraging open source tools and gaining an appreciation of open standards.

## Objectives

- Defining data
- Basing decisions on data and evidence
- Building systems that collect the right data
- Communicating data effectively

## Goals

### Understanding Data

*What is the basic definition of data and how does it differ from information*

Before we can explore data literacy, 
it is important to set a common definition for data 
and to differentiate data from information.   

### Using Data to Make Decisions

*Decisions should be based on data and evidence rather assumptions*

Understanding the importance of facts 
and challenging opinions or positions not 
based on data and evidence.
Understanding key issues about the 
security of data and individual privacy.

### Data-driven Public Services

*Using data to manage services is just as important for the public sector as the private sector*

Understanding that data is no longer 
something that is just collected at a 
particular point in time – instead data is 
being (or has the potential to be) 
constantly created throughout any 
interaction between a user and a service.

### Working with Data Specialists

*A strong relationship between data specialists and non-specialists can lead to the right data being used at the right time to make the right decision.*

Identifying existing data specialists 
working in your topic area: understanding 
what data and information they collect; 
and, what it can and cannot tell you.

### Explaining Data & Results

*Being able to effectively with non-specialists about data and the results of analysis is just important as collecting and analysing the data*

Understanding that some people aren’t as 
naturally comfortable with numbers and 
data as others. Communicating key 
themes from results and simple “need-to-knows” about methodology and 
limitations.

## Canadian Examples

- Civic Tech Ottawa has a group looking at spending within the Government of Canada. This is partly a experiment in data science, but also an exercise in public accountability. So far they have scraped data from 32 federal departments and can import that into a MySQL file for easy access. this has already been useful in finding a more acurate account of spending on the IBM PHoenix Pay System. More information is available from. https://github.com/GoC-Spending
