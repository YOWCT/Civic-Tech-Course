# Data Literacy

The world has been experiencing a data revolution in recent years, yet it is widely held that government is not making the best use of the data it produces or has access to. The nature of the data is also changing: there is an ever greater and increasing volume, velocity and variety of data available. Alongside traditional analytical professions (statisticians, economists, researchers) a new type of activity and occupation (‘data science’ and the 'data scientist‘) has emerged from individuals who are able to exploit these new forms of data. 

As a result of the data revolution there is an inherent demand for a greater number of analysts and data scientists in government – that can be achieved through a mix of external hiring and retraining of existing staff. Simply increasing the number of data experts in government does not automatically mean that government will successfully exploit the opportunities of the data revolution. Nor can we expect that all public servants become professional - level data experts capable of developing algorithms to mine extremely large repositories of unstructured data. 

However, we should aspire that all public servants are "data literate", that is that they can appreciate the value and importance of data, are able to work with data experts, and that data and analysis are not an "after thought"  as they too often have been in the past.

## Using data to make decisions 

Evidence based policy has been a long-held mantra of government, the data revolution provides new opportunities to ensure that information, evidence and data are used to drive decision making not opinions, assumptions, hunches and guesses.

## Data-driven public services

Moving beyond incorporating data into decision-making, collecting and recording data needs to take place throughout a public service, not just recording the interim and final outcomes of a user’s interaction but also metadata the captures the nature and quality of user experience. 
Regular data feeds can also be designed to provide alerts about potential/emerging issues.

## Working with data specialists

Analysts and data scientists shouldn’t just be consulted when an official thinks “we need data”, instead they should be part of project teams and fully involved throughout the life and delivery of a project.

## Explaining data and results

Meanwhile, data experts in government, in addition to having strong technical skills that they regularly update, also have to be able to communicate effectively with non-experts about the results of their data projects and how to develop systems that collect good data.
