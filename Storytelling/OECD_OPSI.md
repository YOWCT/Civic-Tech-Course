# Storytelling

Stories have been a part of human culture since the dawn 
of language. Storytelling can be used by leaders and others 
within organisations in a number of ways: to explain who 
you are, to teach lessons, to outline the future, and to 
inspire action in others. Change in the public sector is no 
longer about moving from static state A to static state B, 
instead change is a constant companion – changing 
operating environments, changing expectations, changing 
user needs.

## Using narratives
Stories communicate facts, opinions, and emotions by 
relaying the experiences of key actors and stakeholders. 
This situational approach to communication can help 
audiences better comprehend key messages. Stories should 
be “living documents” that adapt to focus on an audience’s 
priorities and as projects progress. Stories don’t just have to 
talk about the past and the present but can be a useful way 
to engage people in talking about the (possible) future.

## Telling user stories

By incorporating 'user stories' that set out the current user 
experience when interacting with a service and/or the 
future experience that users will have as a result of the 
changes officials can help others empathise with users and 
better understand user needs.

# Working multiple media and methods

Stories don’t just have to be verbal constructions, images 
and graphics can provide useful metaphors or ways to help 
bring key messages to life. Videos allow ways for the voices 
of others to be part of the story you are telling. Interactive 
methods can enable your audience to build their own 
journey through your narrative, or to contribute their own 
stories to it.

# Teaching lessons

Sharing experience is a crucial component to public sector 
innovation. By telling the story of your own innovation 
projects you can share lesson about what you found 
worked and didn’t work, so that others can learn from your 
own experience.
