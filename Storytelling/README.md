# Storytelling

Storytelling is about communicating in an ever changing world, telling the “story” of change helps build support and engage people by talking about the past, present and possible futures

Let's remember to **start with user needs** and build them into the process to ensure it is relevant. 

## Objectives

- Using narratives to explain 'the journey'
- Including 'user stories' to outline benefits
- Progressing the story as situations change

## Goals

### Using Naratives

*Stories are a natural way in which people share information and pass on knowledge*

Understanding that stories communicate 
facts, opinions and situations by relaying
experiences, making it easier for audiences 
to comprehend key messages.

### Telling User Stories

*Stories can be a powerful and effective way of expressing user needs and priorities*

User stories are a way of communicating 
the way a user or groups of users 
experience a policy or service, they enable 
officials to empathise with the user and 
understand their needs.

### Workign with Multiple Media and Methods

*Different people absorb information in different ways, using a variety of methods helps spread your message as far as possible*

Understanding that metaphors and 
imagery are powerful devices in stories 
that can help explain complex ideas or 
situations.

### Teaching Lessons

*Public sector innovation is driven by exchanging knowledge and practice. Stories can be a useful device for sharing your experiences.*

Sharing experiences is an important 
element of public sector innovation, by 
sharing your experiences you help ensure 
people don’t have to learn the same 
lessons over and over.
