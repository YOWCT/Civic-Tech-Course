Storytelling is about communicating in an ever changing world, telling the “story” of change helps build support and engage people by talking about the past, present and possible futures

## Objectives

- Using narratives to explain 'the journey'
- Including 'user stories' to outline benefits
- Progressing the story as situations change

## Goals

### Using Naratives

*Stories are a natural way in which people share information and pass on knowledge*

Understanding that stories communicate 
facts, opinions and situations by relaying
experiences, making it easier for audiences 
to comprehend key messages.

### Telling User Stories

*Stories can be a powerful and effective way of expressing user needs and priorities*

User stories are a way of communicating 
the way a user or groups of users 
experience a policy or service, they enable 
officials to empathise with the user and 
understand their needs.

### Workign with Multiple Media and Methods

*Different people absorb information in different ways, using a variety of methods helps spread your message as far as possible*

Understanding that metaphors and 
imagery are powerful devices in stories 
that can help explain complex ideas or 
situations.

### Teaching Lessons

*Public sector innovation is driven by exchanging knowledge and practice. Stories can be a useful device for sharing your experiences.*

Sharing experiences is an important 
element of public sector innovation, by 
sharing your experiences you help ensure 
people don’t have to learn the same 
lessons over and over.
