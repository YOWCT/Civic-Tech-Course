# Curiosity

Curiosity and creative thinking help identify new ideas, new ways of working and new approaches. It may mean something brand new or adapting someone elseâ€™s approach.

## Objectives

- Identifying new ideas, ways of working
- Adapting approaches used elsewhere
- Reframing problems and perspectives

## Goals

### Seeking Out New Ideas

*Innovation is about invention, creating new things, and doing things differently.*

Understanding that the current way of 
working is just one of many possible 
approaches, and that each approach has 
its own advantages and limitations.

### Reframing Problems & Ideas

*There is no right way to approach a problem or situation, and investigate a problem from only one angle can hide issues and opportunities.*

Understanding and appreciating that 
people have different perspectives on a 
topic, problem or situation as a result of 
their background, experience and 
knowledge.

### Adapting Approaches

*Many teams have similar objectives, but they rarely have the same approach to meeting those goals*

Understanding that there is no single way 
of doing things, while systems and public 
services are often standardised for 
operational efficiency other organisations 
can have a different approach

### Continuously Learning

*Knowledge is being produced and practices are evolving at an ever increasing rate*

Understanding that in a constantly 
changing world knowledge and practice 
are no longer fixed, there is always 
something new happening somewhere.
