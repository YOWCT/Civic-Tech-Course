- Where and how do you keep your skills and knowledge up to date when it comes to these topics?
- Do you have any suggestions for this class when it comes to building buy-in and support for these concepts? How can we find and/or build community around these ideas?
- What advice do you have for the folks in this class who are working to put these concepts into practice in and around the public service?
