# Curiosity

Innovation in the public sector is about introducing new 
and improved products, services, ways of working to deliver 
better outcomes for citizens and improved operational 
efficiency. Therefore, curiosity and thinking creatively are 
part of the essential life blood of innovation – they are the 
action of finding out new things. Many people will say "I'm 
not creative", but everybody has the capacity and ability to 
be creative. 

## Seeking out new ideas

Having curiosity can be as simple as getting feedback from 
stakeholders and users about how something is currently 
working, what they would suggest you do differently. Using 
workshops and challenges can provide structured ways to 
sources new ideas, while crowd-sourcing and text-mining 
can provide large volumes of information that you can sift 
for patterns and trends.

## Reframing problems and solutions

Everybody has their own way of thinking about a situation 
or problem, and everybody has their own ideas about how 
to solve it. Reframing techniques allow to think about a 
problem from a different perspective or to challenge 
default assumptions – for example, asking questions such 
as "how would X go about this?" or "what if we did/did not 
have to do Y?".

## Adapting approaches

Curiosity is also about finding out how other people do a 
similar job or deliver a similar service to see if they do it 
differently; moving beyond those who are similar, one can 
look at other examples of success, work out why that way 
of working is successful and trying to adapt that 
approach/their own approach to duplicate that success.

## Continuously learning

An important part of being curious and creative is adopting 
a mindset of continuously learning – being able to absorb 
and use new ideas, identifying your own limitations and 
learning more about them. New knowledge is being 
produced all the time, some of it may challenge our existing 
thinking and force us to “unlearn” things we already know 
or do.
