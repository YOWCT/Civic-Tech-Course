# Insurgency

Insurgency means challenging the status quo and the usual way of doing things, it means working with new and different partners to gain new insights or deliver projects.

It is about boldly **working across silos** inside and outside of government.

## Objectives

- Challenging the usual way of doing things
- Working with unusual/ different partners
- Building alliances for change

## Goals

### Challenging the Status Quo

*Innovation is about doing something new and there are often many voices that resist doing things differently*

Understanding that “it’s always been done 
this way” is not an acceptable defence for 
poor service performance or quality. 
Meanwhile, alternative approaches should 
not be dismissed because of a “if it’s not 
broken don’t fix it” mentality.

### Trying Out Things that May Not Work

*Public services need to “fail fast”, identifying more quickly and earlier when something isn’t working and why.*

Understanding and accepting that when 
trying something new there is a possibility 
it might not work. This should not be 
viewed as “failure” but an opportunity to 
learn more – identifying what does and 
does not work.

### Building Alliances for Change

*The challenges faced by the public sector today demands greater and deeper collaboration*

Trying to innovate in the public sector on 
your own can be a lonely and impossible 
challenge, collaboration with others can 
improve your chances of success and the 
provide a safe space to explore ideas and 
ask questions.

### Working with Unusual Partners

*Working with people you might not ordinarily consider could result new synergies and approaches.*

People who are very different from you or 
who work on something very different, is 
no reason not to work with them, they 
may have valuable insights and practices 
that you haven’t thought of.
