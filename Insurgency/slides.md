# Secrets of successful rebels 1

# Tactics: Actions to achieve specific End
- Tap into the brilliance of others, knowing that no now can create meaningful change alone.
- Align ideas with the organization’s goals. The more important an idea is to an organization the more likely it will be adopted.
- Show how the benefits of change are commensurate with the costs of change.
- Use conflict productively: glean insignias from disagreement and conflict to learn how to remind and advance an idea.
- Let ideas breathe, give people time to absorb a new idea and consider its implications.

# Secrets of successful rebels 2
 
# Behaviours: How you conduct yourself toward others
- Stay positive: optimism inspires others to join them in fixing problems.
- Judge ideas, not people. Steer conversations away from personalities to focus on ideas and their merits.
- Learn from anger: consider what triggers anger and avoid spiralling into emotional drama.
- Respect others and consider different viewpoints.
- Know when to walk away, whinge the importance of the idea and the professional costs of preserving.
