# User-centricity 

The idea of involving citizens in developing public services is not new, and "customer focus" has been mantra of management consultancies for decades. However, the arrival of the digital government agenda, and the subsequent bottom-up development of new online services has placed the idea of "user needs" at the focal point of both policy making and service design – in both the US and the UK, user needs are the first principle of government guidelines for developing digital public services.

## Solving user needs

Being user centred is about finding out what users need to do and designing a policy/service that meets those needs, rather than what government assumes/thinks those needs are. All public servants should consider whether their project, policy or service is meeting user needs, and that user needs will change over time. While secondary sources such as existing evidence/analysis, talking to employees that work with users or organisations that deliver services to users, it is important to include primary research with users when identifying, and validating, user needs–qualitative and ethnographic methods (e.g. in-depth interviews and observation) are particularly useful for identifying needs.

## Focusing on users at every step

Projects must have sufficient resources and time allocated for discovering and analysing user needs, and incorporating regular opportunities through the life of a project to undertake research/testing with users to check what is being developed or implement is meeting the needs of the users.

## Considering how users think and act

Users are diverse, no two users are the same, when developing services it is important to make sure it is easy for users to do what they need to do. Human centred design principles allow us to think about how people interact with systems and processes, while behavioural science can help us to analyse the way people think and respond to different situations. It is also important to think about those with different and particular needs (e.g. those with a disability), when developing digital services it is important to consider those whether there users and you need to develop alternative approaches for.

## Involving users in projects

To develop effective user centred services and policies, officials must adopt participative approaches that involve users throughout the life of the project. This may be as simple as undertaking user research at different stages (to identify needs; test prototypes, alpha, beta, and live versions) through to deep participatory exercises such as the co-production of a policy or service which aims to foster a sense of joint ownership of the exercise between officials and users.
