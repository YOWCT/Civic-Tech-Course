# User centricity

User centricity is about having services and policies that are designed to solve user needs, with users considered at every stage of the process so that they will say “I would do that again".

It is about **building great interfaces** and having patterns that make it easy to navigate and discover information. 

## Objectives

- Policies and services solve user needs
- Considering users at every stage
- Ensuring users say "I would do that again"

## Goals

### Solving User Needs

*Public services are delivered for the benefit of citizens. Modern public services should respond to clearly identified needs.*

Understanding that the needs of users 
must be researched and gathered from 
users themselves. Government must not 
assume it knows what users really need.

### Focusing on Users at Every Step

*Users and their needs must be considered at every stage of a project, not just at the beginning and the end.*

The user should always be at the centre of 
a project team’s thinking. Users shouldn’t 
just be considered when generating ideas 
and launching a product or service – but 
throughout the design and development 
of products and services

### Considering How Users Think and Act

*People don’t always behave in the way we expect. Using human centred design principles and behavioural science can result in better policy and services.*

Understanding that by designing policy 
and public services around how human 
beings think and interact will make it 
easier for them to use a product or service 
and thus for government achieve desired 
policy outcomes

### Involving Users in Projects

*Working with “real” users ensures that project teams can better understand user needs and their situation.* 

Like a game of “Chinese whispers” every 
time someone other than a user explains 
or passes on information about a users 
need a bit of that information is missed 
out. The user is always the best source.
