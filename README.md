# Civic Tech Course

Open source Civic Tech course based on The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation's "CORE SKILLS FOR PUBLIC SECTOR INNOVATION" April 2017 beta model.

Use of new technology demands that government services are more responsive and citizen-focused. In order to 
met the exponentially growing demand from citizens governments need a strong understanding of the tools and 
processes of both technology and design. This Civic Tech course will introduce public servants to these concepts to prepare 
them to lead digital transformation in government. Focusing on case studies and practical 
applications, the course will cover emerging best practices in digital government.

By the end of the course, students will be familiar with the tools, methods, and processes of digital 
government, and be able to identify opportunities to apply them to their own work.
