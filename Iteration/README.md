# Iteration

Iteration is about using incremental, often rapid, approaches in the development of a project, product or service while reducing risks. Developing prototypes, conducting tests and experiments can help identify the best solution.

It is about **lowering the barriers for experimentation** and allowing projects to fail forward. 

## Objectives

- Rapid and incremental development
- Developing and refining prototypes
- Experimentation and testing

## Goals

### Managing Innovation Projects

*Projects should be segmented into clearly defined stages which are time limited and have manageable goals.*

Understanding incremental development 
approaches, where each stage of a project 
builds on the one before it.

### Using Prototyes to Explore Approaches

*Models, sketches, mock-ups, sample versions of an approach can be used to explore its feasibility, and develop a project incrementally.*

Understanding how prototypes can be 
used to bring abstract ideas to life, and 
provide a tangible example of how 
something might work in practice.

### Conducting Tests & Experiments

*Tests and experiments provide a robust way of evaluating whether an approach works.*

Understanding how tests and experiments 
can examine what works and what does 
not work.


### Taking Risks but Not with Time or Money

*Iterative and incremental approaches allow you to limit risks associated with testing out approaches or methods you may not have used before.*

Understanding how iterative project 
management approaches allows new 
ideas to be tested on a small scale before 
trying to implement more widely.
