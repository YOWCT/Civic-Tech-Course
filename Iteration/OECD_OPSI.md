# ITERATION

Iteration is about the incremental and progressive development of a project. It is most commonly associated with modern software development practices where new features or updates to functionality are released when they are ready, rather than a "big bang" approach that releases a large number of new/updated features at the same time. Iteration skills aren’t just about project management, using prototypes and conducting experiments can also be considered part of iterative practice.

## Managing innovation projects

Iterative project management techniques (such as sprints or time-boxes, product backlogs or workflows, and retrospectives) where each stage builds on the preceding stage and there is greater opportunity to adapt and amend scope are well suited to delivering innovation projects. However, iterative project management techniques are not necessarily new to government – Lean and other continuous improvement methodologies have been used for many years in some governments to manage operational services.

## Using prototypes to explore approaches

A prototype is an example of what something (a product, a service or system, a policy) might look like. Prototypes are can be used to demonstrate what something might look like, or to test whether something works. Prototypes can also be initial versions which are then incrementally refined and turn into the final product. They can be things you use only as internal “proof of concept” exercises, or things that you use with service users to test feasibility.

## Conducting tests and experiments

Innovation projects typically involve testing whether something works, and using the results of that testing to improve or refine work, or trying something else. Experiments are more robust and formal ways of testing whether something works, and by incorporating randomisation they can control for a range of potential factors that might otherwise influence the results.

## Taking risks, but not with time or money

Iterative approaches and project management methods can enable officials to try out things that may not work, initially at a small scale and then progressively increasingly the scale of the work. Using sand-boxes, prototypes and experiments allows officials to check step-by-step whether something is working and if not take action sooner rather than later.
