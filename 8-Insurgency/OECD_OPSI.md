# Insurgency

Innovators in government are sometimes seen as internal 
'insurgents' or 'rebels', working to change the usual way of 
doing things. If curiosity is the part of the lifeblood of 
innovation that is how we identify new things, then 
insurgency is about making those new things happen. 
Public servants are often typecast risk averse – and often 
with good reason if they are a prison officer or regulate 
nuclear power plants – however, the number of situations 
where an official must not doing something because of a 
risk of direct harm to citizens or national security is 
relatively small.

## Challenging the status quo

Insurgents challenge the status quo and don't accept "it's 
always been done this way" or “if it’s not broke don’t fix it” 
as a defence against change. Innovation often pushes up 
against or even goes beyond existing boundaries and limits 
to do things differently.

## Trying things out that might not work

Giving officials the freedom to try alternative ways of doing 
things, including things that may not work, can provide 
opportunities to find new ways of working that otherwise 
might remain hidden. When something we try new and it 
doesn’t work, this isn’t a “failure” but a learning opportunity 
to find out why it didn’t work and somebody isn’t to blame 
for it not working out.

## Building alliances

Working alone rarely solves problems, particularly in the 
public sector. The challenges faced by public services 
demand increased and deeper collaboration between and 
across organisations. Forging alliances among both internal 
and external partners can create support and demand for 
change by amplifying the message. 

## Working with unusual partners

Innovation can also be the by-product of working with 
unusual or unexpected partners, developing new synergies 
that can lead to the identification of approaches that may 
not have been discovered.
